- Hello world! I'm Geoff Miller, PhD student in the Ecology, Evolution and Behavior program at the University of Minnesota .
- My research is focused on the movement and community ecology interactions in urban coyotes and foxes 🐺🦊. Working with this data efficiently takes a lot of development in R, and that's what many of my Git repos or packages are focused on.
- I'm new to Python 🐍, PostgreSQL 🐘 and Tensorflow 🧠, but I am very well versed in using R and QGIS (and unfortunately proprietary software 🏴‍☠️ such as ArcGIS) for analyses I have done in the past.
- Anyone looking to collaborate on packages focused on working with animal movement data please let me know!
- If you have any questions for me I can be reached at gdevonmiller@gmail.com.
