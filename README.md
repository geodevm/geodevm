- Hello world! I'm Geoff Miller, PhD student in the Ecology, Evolution and Behavior program at the University of Minnesota .
- My research is focused on the movement and community ecology interactions in urban coyotes and foxes. Working with this data efficiently takes a lot of development in R, and that's what many of my Git repos are focused on.
- I'm new to Python, starting in on learning both PostgreSQL and MySQL, but I've put in my hours with R and QGIS (and unfortunately proprietary software üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è such as ArcGIS) for analyses I have done in the past.
- Anyone working with animal movement data please let me know!
- If you have any questions for me I can be reached at gdevonmiller@gmail.com.
